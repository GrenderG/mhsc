This plugin allows you to copy your Monster Hunter character to any
save slot in any lanuage/region of the game. In other words, you can
do things like copy your character from the North American version of
Monster Hunter Freedom Unite to the Japanese version of Monster Hunter
Portable 2nd G. The only requirement is that you must have both the
game you want to copy from and the game you want to copy to.
